# DeeCamp 2018 Personal repo for Ziqun Zhou  
## Docs  
Documents and notes. Mainly notes written with OneNote.  
## Code  
Python code. ~~Mainly pytorch~~. Now mainly TensorFlow.  
## Diary  
### Before 2018-08-02  
- Data cleaning. Remove dirty sentences and add pinyin notation(by Junli Wang).  
- Walk through RNN, LSTM and GRU in great mathematical detail  
- Implement char-RNN, LSTM in tf and pytorch  
- Dive into the docs of pytorch  
### 2018-08-02  
- Moved from PyTorch to TensorFlow QAQ.  
- Group meeting with tutor Wang. Re-unite the group and focus on one daily target everyday now.  
- Start to learn seq2seq emplemented with tf by Yunsheng pwp.  
- Group Q&A meeting. Discuss questions 1-6(RNN, LSTM) but some remains unclear. Need to use tutor for more detailed answer.  
### 2018-08-03  
- Being assigned to algorithm group. Prepare to read paper about skip through vector.  
- Prepare to write final website for presentation using Vue.js as frontend framework.  
- Dive into Ruichang's seq2seq model in tf but not finished yet.  
- Discussed with Zili and got a very deep understanding about LSTM as well as how to implement LSTM from scratch.  
- Make weekly video by sing 《祖传程序员》 :)  
### 2018-08-04 - 2018-08-05  
- Make a install image for UCloud GPU VM including CUDA 9, cudnn 7 and tensorflow-gpu  
- Add teacher forcing to Yunsheng's model using ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper  
- Try to train Yunsheng's model on both local GPU and UCloud GPU, however there seems to be some problems when restoring checkpoints in UCloud GPU. Need discussion tomorrow
